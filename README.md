# Testing of Realworld App
My tests for [Conduit app](https://demo.realworld.io/#/) by [Thinkster](https://github.com/gothinkster) (API and GUI tests).

All of these test presents as the example of my training in GUI and API testing.

Used technologies and frameworks (the list is supplemented):
- Postman
- Selenium (+ Java + JUnit + Maven + Allure)
- Qase (main TMS for now) + Github App
